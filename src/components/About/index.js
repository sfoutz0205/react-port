      <p id="">My name is Sophie Foutz. I am 29 years old and currently living in Santa Fe, NM. I work for 
              the family business, a Native American art gallery called Shiprock Santa Fe and, for the past
              six months, I have been attending an online coding boot-camp through the University of Utah. I am
              excited to continue to learn and grow in the tech field and look forward to beginning down this new 
              career path.
